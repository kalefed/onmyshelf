  On My Shelf
</h1>
<p align="center">
I've loved using various book trackers like Goodreads, Fable and Storygraph but I found myself wanting a place to see detailed statistics on my reading. For example, how much money have I saved by going to the library? Or insights into the diversity of my shelf. So, I wanted to create something to solve this problem, and focus on strengthening my full stack development skills. And that's how "On My Shelf" was born!
